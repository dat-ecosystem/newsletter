# Dat Project Newsletter
_April 2019_

Here's a summary of some of the things that came up in the Dat ecosystem this month.


## Berlin-related events around DTN

[Karissa McKelvey aka @okdistribute](Karissa McKelvey) from [Code for Science and Society](https://codeforscience.org/) is organizing some Dat related events near the [Data Terra Nemo conference](https://dtn.is/). Planning is happening [on Github](https://github.com/datproject/organization/issues/4), and was discussed during the recent [Dat comm-comm](https://github.com/dat-land/comm-comm/blob/master/meeting-notes/19-25April2019.md). Check out what we're planning and keep an eye out for RSVPs.

## Getting Dat to work in new environments
_by Georgiy Shibaev_

"Current implementations focus on Node.js-based applications, or are being abstracted away with high level APIs in the Beaker Browser. What I worked on as part of the handshake funding was to explore getting these modules to work in new environments outside of Node, namely on mobile devices with React Native, updating the tooling for Dat apps in the non-distributed web, and adding a standard service for storing Dats to the CLI."

## C++ implementation of Dat in the works

[Paolo F. aka @heapwolf](https://github.com/heapwolf) has started working on a [C++ implementation of Dat](https://github.com/datcxx) with the hopes of making it easier to integrate with mobile projects.

## Dat "mounts" are coming

On the roadmap to having multi writer support, [Mathias Buus aka @mafintosh](https://github.com/mafintosh/) and [Andrew Osheroff aka @andrewosh](https://github.com/andrewosh) are working on a [new version of hyperdrive](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive/pull/233) which enables people to "mount" other archives at a given path. This works kind of like [Symbolic Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) from regular filesystems.

## The new networking layer is being polished for release

[David Mark Clements](https://github.com/davidmarkclements) has started working on adding [tests](https://github.com/hyperswarm/guts/commits?author=davidmarkclements) to the new [Hyperswarm](https://github.com/hyperswarm) networking library. Once Hyperswarm is tested and integrated with the rest of the dat ecosystem, we should have faster peer lookups, and better NAT hole punching for connecting between peers.

## Handle multiple Dats / Hypercores from a single swarm

If you're working on a project using Dat, you might have come across performance issues when you're trying to share a bunch of Dats over the network at once. Luckily, [Joe Hand](https://github.com/joehand) has recently updated the [Hyperdiscovery module](https://github.com/karissa/hyperdiscovery/pull/18) to automatically handle multiple Dats on a single swarm. This will be handy for anyone working at the low level, and Joe is working on integrating it with [The Node.js Dat API](https://github.com/datproject/dat-node) to make it even easier to use.

## Patchbay (SSB Client) support for Dat

[Anders Rune Jensen](https://github.com/arj03) from the [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) community recently added [support for loading files from Dat](http://between-two-worlds.dk:8807/%25rbQ6ggItkXWd3EPZ%2FG6zIOIN2r%2Bd14v2egEVqvxbXoo%3D.sha256) to the [Patchbay SSB client](https://github.com/ssbc/patchbay/pull/326). You can read more about what this means [here](http://between-two-worlds.dk:8807/%jDEB8e31x+tIzBql6b8dGmhn58+t9kytYXi5X15CSi4=.sha256)

## DWeb Camp 2019

Dweb Camp is a four-day event sponsored by the Internet Archive where people interested in the Decentralized Web are going to get together and hack on a local mesh network.

## Local-first Software

[Ink & Switch](https://twitter.com/inkandswitch) published an article about the importance of local-first software and it's implications on security and long-term sustainability.
