# Dat Project Newsletter
_April 2019_

Here's a summary of some of the things that came up in the Dat ecosystem this month.


## Berlin-related events around DTN

[Karissa McKelvey aka @okdistribute](Karissa McKelvey) from [Code for Science and Society](https://codeforscience.org/) is organizing some Dat related events near the [Data Terra Nemo conference](https://dtn.is/). Planning is happening [on Github](https://github.com/datproject/organization/issues/4), and was discussed during the recent [Dat comm-comm](https://github.com/dat-land/comm-comm/blob/master/meeting-notes/19-25April2019.md). Check out what we're planning and keep an eye out for RSVPs.

## Getting Dat to work in new environments
_by Georgiy Shibaev_

"Current implementations focus on Node.js-based applications, or are being abstracted away with high level APIs in the Beaker Browser. What I worked on as part of the handshake funding was to explore getting these modules to work in new environments outside of Node, namely on mobile devices with React Native, updating the tooling for Dat apps in the non-distributed web, and adding a standard service for storing Dats to the CLI."

## C++ implementation of Dat in the works

[Paolo F. aka @heapwolf](https://github.com/heapwolf) has started working on a [C++ implementation of Dat](https://github.com/datcxx) with the hopes of making it easier to integrate with mobile projects.

## Dat "mounts" are coming

On the roadmap to having multi writer support, [Mathias Buus aka @mafintosh](https://github.com/mafintosh/) and [Andrew Osheroff aka @andrewosh](https://github.com/andrewosh) are working on a [new version of hyperdrive](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive/pull/233) which enables people to "mount" other archives at a given path. This works kind of like [Symbolic Links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) from regular filesystems.

## The new networking layer is being polished for release

[David Mark Clements](https://github.com/davidmarkclements) has started working on adding [tests](https://github.com/hyperswarm/guts/commits?author=davidmarkclements) to the new [Hyperswarm](https://github.com/hyperswarm) networking library. Once Hyperswarm is tested and integrated with the rest of the dat ecosystem, we should have faster peer lookups, and better NAT hole punching for connecting between peers.
