# Dat Project Newsletter
_April 2019_

Here's a summary of some of the things that came up in the Dat ecosystem this month.


## Berlin-related events around DTN

Code for Science and Society is going to be organizing some Dat related events near the [Data Terra Nemo conference](https://dtn.is/). Organization is happening [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/datproject/organization/issues/4), and was discussed during the recent [Dat comm-comm](https://github.com/dat-land/comm-comm/blob/master/meeting-notes/19-25April2019.md). Check out what we're planning and keep an eye out for RSVPs.

## Getting Dat to work in new environments
_by Georgiy Shibaev_

"Current implementations focus on Node.js-based applications, or are being abstracted away with high level APIs in the Beaker Browser. What I worked on as part of the handshake funding was to explore getting these modules to work in new environments outside of Node, namely on mobile devices with React Native, updating the tooling for Dat apps in the non-distributed web, and adding a standard service for storing Dats to the CLI."
