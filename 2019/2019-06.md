## SimplyEdit in Beaker

[SimplyEdit](dat://blog-ylebre.sharespace.nl/) is a Content Management System that lets people graphically edit P2P websites. You can fork their [Hello World](dat://blog-ylebre.sharespace.nl/helloworld/) example and edit it's contents directly from the website, [or check out their docs](https://simplyedit.io/for-developers/) for more advanced uses.

## Beaker's Unwalled Garden Spec
