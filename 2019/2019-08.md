## Building up on dat
_by Diego_

[Diego](https://twitter.com/carax) from [Geut](https://github.com/geut) presented [his guide](https://github.com/geut/building-up-on-dat) on how to build with Dat at Nodeconf Colombia. Part of the guide contained an example React app for viewing Dats called [Datviewer](https://github.com/geut/building-up-on-dat/blob/master/packages/datviewer) and a Node.js package manager for loading modules from Dat called [gpm](https://github.com/geut/building-up-on-dat/tree/master/packages/gpm).

## Alpha release of Cliqz concept browser

[Cliqz](https://cliqz.com/en/latest) is a privacy-focused web browser built on top of Firefox. They recently released the APK for an alpha version of their new Firefox-based Android web browser which integrates the [Dat Firefox extension](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/dat-webext). Check out the download [here](https://github.com/cliqz/cliqz-concept-browser/releases).

## Dat SDK

The first version of the Dat Software Development Kit has been released. The SDK is made to simplify building applications with Dat and deploying them to different platforms. It does this by abstracting away storage and replication and providing the Hyperdrive and Hypercore APIs so you can focus on the data.

[Here's a quote](https://twitter.com/RangerMauve/status/1154470449549590528) from one of it's first users.

## New ACK feature in Hypercore
_by Substack_

[Substack](https://github.com/substack) recently submitted a pull request to the hypercore repo which adds an "acknowledgement" message for sending data. This should help applications determine when peers have actually persisted data you've sent them and will help open the door to stuff like read receipts in Cabal and knowing when to break connections when syncing with a pub in the CLI.
