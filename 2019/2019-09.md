Recently, he was working on integrating Dat into Patchfox so that one could load and share data through Dat Archives.

## Boom-Box
_by Mix_

[Mix](https://github.com/mixmix) from the SSB community recently whipped up a Dat app which eats Dat mix-tapes. You can make a mix tape by create a Dat archive and putting music files in it (and optionally an image), or use an existing archive.

Then, you open up [boom-box](dat://d2e61d716d919ae78cdf980d27e2d50463cce94af4350303ee0e79f03261dbab/) and stick the mix-tape in the input. Boom-box will remember mix tapes you've loaded so you can easily listen to them again when you come back to it.

## A Hunger Artist
_by Zach_

Zach (%pGuhbPuVFuccPKyQlnzrdDT5OS6p/uubyp2GBu7R8RA=.sha256 on SSB) was looking at the response to the recent [funding experiment](https://feross.org/npm-install-funding/) by Feross and was reminded of a Franz Kafka story which he made into a Zine.
