## Dat Slideshow
_by Andrew_

Andrew (@1U65GGx/QOUu6sVSgx8FeGDAZWUeNKSYBvrv8FXXINY=.ed25519 on SSB) put together a presentation application using the Dat APIs in Beaker. Their description: "The idea is to allow people to quickly create a deck of slides that could be shared during or at the end of talks and presentations over the local network. The link below should work in beaker browser whilst I am online so anyone can fork it and create their own presentation with it." Check out the post about it on Secure Scuttlebutt: %JMkASE4Crf6m204yyDmeD2YxtFwfDnVeRM9zA7UFsYE=.sha256 or load it in Beaker directly: dat://7bbc546b3318114cba409c383a1d8dfe4b48081f5cdde7a05e0ab961a3904dcd/

## Publishing the Cargo registry on Dat
_by Agent of User_

[Agent of User](https://github.com/agentofuser) has been experimenting with mirroring Rust crates (modules) from [crates.io](https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25M8DEDuxZZhg7Ly4VVJnE3Az1N7tSCWw5v2AuO2ay3h8%3D.sha256) (kinda like Rust's NPM) through Dat and IPFS. You can help the effort by seeding the dat archive, or contributing to the effort. dat://91067272f618b28f22c02a6f95089e9ffbf120016d8f1023ad74575bd03d77ca
